# Why a runtime hook and not an image-build step: the Claude MCP
# registration needs the claude CLI, and the claude CLI is injected per
# container by jackin's derived-image build (Agent::install_block in
# jackin's src/agent/mod.rs), not baked into the published architect
# image. Trying to run `claude mcp add …` at architect-image build time
# silently no-ops because the binary is not on PATH yet.

# ── caveman-shrink MCP middleware proxy ───────────────────────────────
#
# caveman-shrink wraps another MCP server's stdio and caveman-compresses
# the responses before they reach the agent — used to cut the token
# cost of verbose MCP servers (filesystem, github, search, etc.). By
# itself the registration is a placeholder that spawns the upstream
# package; you wire it against a specific server later by editing the
# `mcpServers` entry to put the real upstream after the caveman-shrink
# arg list, e.g.:
#
#   {
#     "mcpServers": {
#       "fs-shrunk": {
#         "command": "npx",
#         "args": ["caveman-shrink", "npx",
#                  "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path"]
#       }
